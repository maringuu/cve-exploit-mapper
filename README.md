# cve-exploit-mapper
This python module creates a single database that allows mapping a CVE to a concrete exploit.

## Database
The produced csv contains three columns.
The first column is the CVE Id.
The second column is a link to an exploit.
The third column is the link to the source of the infomation.

Note that one exploit can have multiple CVEs and one CVE can have multiple exploits.
